# Optimized_Real_time_Scheduling_Problem
I worked on optimizing real-time task scheduling problems on heterogeneous systems using Linear programming techniques by leveraging the power of the NetwrorkX Python library to create task dependency graphs, which provided a comprehensive representation of the relationships between tasks and their dependencies.
used DAG-based parallel applications namely Gaussian Elimination and Epigenomics.

 I used  NetwrorkX Python library that is used for  algorithm design, data analysis, and performance optimization.
